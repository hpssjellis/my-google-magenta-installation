Getting Googles Magenta working on Cloud9 for Music Creation


June 9th, 2016

Like with everything Tensorflow, just getting the basics working is a challenge. So far I have setup-on-cloud9.sh working on cloud9 but the bazel build is over 2Gb which is the free limit on Cloud9. The file that includes most of the tensorflow full installation setup-c9-tensorflow.sh is just going to be bigger so it will not work.

Having some luck with setup-linux-laptop.sh on a linux ubuntu laptop installation. 

Tried installing on a windows computer using batch files but that is not going to succeed since Bazel does not presently install very nicely on windows.

You might want to see my Tensorflow installation on cloud 9 at https://github.com/hpssjellis/forth-tensorflow 




June 6, 2016. Just found the github site for Google's Magenta Music Tensorflow site. So let's install it on Cloud 9

run the bash file setup.sh to install bazel, tensorflow and magenta
